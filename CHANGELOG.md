## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Read-only **Why this suggestion?** pane in the event detail (slice of #25): shows `decision`, `reason`, `role`, `conf`, `needs_oracle` and `answers.role.probabilities` as recorded; absent fields show `unknown`, a null `reason` is never filled in, and nothing implies which model executed (#58).
- Read-only **Sessions inspector** as the ninth view (key `9`): a per-source session list (source id on each row in the combined view), and a session detail with a scope header that says it is a sample, an ordered timeline that shares the existing replay cursor, the selected row's fields with recorded / enriched / not-available chips (glyph, word and border pattern), this session's permission verdicts (same data and handling as Errors) and a fixed `ROUTER · recommendation, not execution` block. Entry from a selected event with key `s` or the event detail `session` action; `Esc` goes detail → list → close; a `← sessions` control replaces the two panes at 1100 px and below. It is a panel over the stage only, so the header, nav, scope strip and ticker stay visible and Call in focus stays pinned at its top. No execute, retry, approve or deny control and no success wording. `sessionTimeline` now has one definition shared by replay, the event detail and the inspector (#43, #4).
- Pure session inspection model over retained evidence: `inspectSession` and `listSessions` expose ordered events, linked permissions, errors, scope coverage and per-field evidence state without claiming completeness. Sessions are isolated by source, unknown sessions return empty results, and execution/usage fields are always marked unavailable (#42).

### Changed
- Apply the approved Lane Bay identity to the existing switchboard: graphite surfaces, distinct selection and warning colors, role shapes, separate navigation/scope rows, responsive ticker columns and compact call focus. Keep aggregate statistics separate from calls, preserve existing source/filter/replay behavior and expose detailed browser-payload rejection counts in Errors (#33).

### Fixed
- Stop setting `OPENCODE_DISABLE_LSP_DOWNLOAD` for the stats child (and strip any inherited value): the token is absent from the OpenCode 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 binaries, so it was not a verified safeguard.

### Maintenance
- Record, as documentation only, the maintainer-approved read-only Sessions inspector contract (entry from a selected event with key `s`, session list as a ninth view on key `9` with a no-tab fallback, scope header, recorded/enriched/not-available field states, permission verdicts, “not execution” labelling, source id on each row in the combined list). It revises DESIGN's “no new views” rule; the ninth-tab fit is font/CSS arithmetic pending a browser measurement in #43; no code or captures are included (#41, #4).
- Record the accepted Lane Bay design contract in `docs/DESIGN.md` (graphite tokens, type scale, narrow-width hierarchy, evidence-preserving states, deferred items) as documentation only; the shipped UI keeps the previous identity until the separately approved implementation lands (#32, #33).
- Re-verify the stats contract, CLI flags and default paths against installed OpenCode 2.2.6 (isolated empty profile) and adopt it as the documented baseline.
- Document that only the maintainer approves issue-backed work, that agents record `Approved` solely from an explicit maintainer instruction, and that project `Status` and issue progress comments stay current as work advances (#44).
- Require durable, privacy-safe progress records in associated issues for material decisions, research findings, validation results and handoffs, without expanding implementation or publication permissions.
- Strengthen project agent workflows with approval/worktree/release preflights, evidence-contract and isolated UI-verification skills, dry-run evaluation cases, and structural guidance checks; document the product roadmap and Electron direction without implementing or approving future features.
- Update Biome to 2.6.5 and align its configuration schema without changing lint rules or formatting application code.
- Update TypeScript to 7.0.2 and declare the existing stylesheet as an exact side-effect asset, preserving errors for unresolved CSS imports.
- Configure weekly Dependabot proposals for Bun and GitHub Actions against `develop`, without automatic merging; document native issue auto-add setup and manual approval triage.
- Add a proposal/research intake form that distinguishes evaluation from implementation approval, plus a private vulnerability reporting policy and issue-chooser link.
- Complete the collaboration baseline: squash-only protected PRs, current CI and resolved conversations for administrators too, a task label, and an explicit proposal/approval project workflow without mandatory external reviews for a sole maintainer.
- Guard release publication against tags outside `main` history, with local Git regression coverage; document issue planning and repository administration.

### Added in 0.2.0
- M7: read-only headless agents, SSH-first remote sources, explicit authenticated non-loopback binds, bounded HTTP/SSE collection, reconnect health and namespaced source identities.
- M8: user-configured subscription quota estimates, evidence-aware preset comparisons, sampled slim config timelines, debounced alerts and opt-in desktop notifications.
- M9: source selection and health, exchange analytics panels and retained-session replay synchronized with Call in focus.
- M10: source/range-aware Markdown and CSV reports through CLI and GET downloads, with formula escaping and explicit incomplete-range coverage.

### Security in 0.2.0
- Refuse wildcard agent binds, require strong bearer tokens outside loopback, reject browser-origin agent requests and prevent redirect/proxy credential forwarding.
- Bound remote records, snapshots and stream frames; isolate over-budget sources without starving healthy ones. Tokens remain server-side environment references, never browser state.

### Fixed in 0.2.0
- M12: use OS temporary directories in tests instead of assuming the agent's pre-created `/tmp/opencode`, so clean CI environments can run the unchanged assertions.
- M11: expose active alert evidence directly in the ticker, scoped to the selected source and linked to the existing alert panel.
- Support differing SSH tunnel ports in the agent Host check and reject incompatible agent retention settings before startup.
- Verify installed OpenCode 2.2.5 stats output in an isolated empty profile; retain supported `--standalone` and remove unsupported `OPENCODE_PURE`.
- Restore focus on selected-event eviction, retain orphaned filter choices, expose rejected UI payload counts and adapt sparse patch bays.

### Evidence limits in 0.2.0
- Missing execution, fallback and per-message usage remain unknown. Preset-file samples are not proof of runtime selection; classifier rate limits are distinct from execution-provider limits. No subscription limits are invented.

### Added
- M1: validated, unknown-field-preserving parsers for observe, route, permissions and stats; malformed JSONL counting and fixture tests.
- M2: deterministic message joins, context agreement matrix and confidence histogram, usage breakdowns, permission/error rollups and honest unavailable-data readouts.
- M3: configurable loopback HTTP/SSE server, rotation-safe JSONL tailing, bounded stats polling, offline stats-file mode and source health states.
- M4a: switchboard shell with local IBM Plex Mono/Instrument Sans fonts, ghost suggestion wires, context jacks, aggregate model rail, dense ticker, raw event drawer and fixture replay screenshots.
- M4: Flow, Agreement, Usage, Errors and History drawers; pure event filters, search/keyboard navigation, session timeline and fixture-backed smoke tests for every view.
- M5: atomic non-overwriting weekly snapshots, bounded live History loading, one-shot snapshot CLI, package-relative assets and optional systemd user service/timer examples.
- M6: individually configurable log paths, 10k-line startup/SSE checks, shutdown regression coverage and a portable same-origin browser verifier with safe demo-only burst checks.

### Fixed
- Prompt-rate readouts now exclude session-only route exceptions; page-clock windows expire without new source events, and focused buttons retain their native Enter behavior.

### Clarified
- Execution agent/model, fallback and per-message usage cannot be inferred from the supplied logs; agreement is explicitly context-only.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03
### Added
- Project scaffold: SPEC, DESIGN, ARCHITECTURE, PLAN, fixtures, CI, kickoff prompt.
- Repo conventions: branch model, PR/issue templates, agent skills, release workflow.
