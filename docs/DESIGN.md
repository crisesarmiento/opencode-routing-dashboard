# DESIGN

This is the UI contract for **Route** (formerly opencode-routing-dashboard).

The UI must be beautiful, original, dynamic and fun, and dense. It is explicitly **not** a generic AI dashboard.

## Contract status

- **Accepted in merged PR [#39](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/pull/39):** the **Lane Bay** contract below (issue [#32](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/32), parent [#23](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/23); maintainer decisions recorded in [the #32 comment](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/32#issuecomment-6714423966)). It is the target for UI work in #33.
- **#33 has separate [bounded-scope approval](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/33#issuecomment-6715778224).** This implementation applies that slice; the previously shipped UI uses amber-phosphor until #33 lands. This approval does not extend to the deferred items below or the rest of #23.
- The sections "Previous identity" and the M4a/M4/M9/M11 reviews at the end describe what ships today. They stay as the historical record and as the baseline for any UI work done before #33.
- **Approved by the maintainer on 2026-11-08 in [#41](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/41) (parent [#4](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/4)):** the read-only **Sessions inspector** in the section "Sessions inspector" below. It is an exception to the "no new views" rule in "Navigation and terminology" and to the eight-view list under "Concept". The exception takes effect when the PR that records it merges. It authorizes only the follow-up work in #42 (model) and #43 (view and captures), each still needing its own start.
- **Layout measured in isolated Linux Chromium for #33.** The layout table below records DOM measurements against anonymized DEMO inputs, not just static mockup arithmetic. Contrast ratios are **computed with the WCAG formula on token hex pairs; they are not an accessibility audit.** Keyboard, focus, reduced motion and rendering rules are the contract; executed checks and their limits are recorded separately in [VERIFICATION](VERIFICATION.md).
- Mockups behind this contract are static drawings labeled `DEMO · STATIC MOCKUP · PROPOSAL`, built from the anonymized fixtures. They are referenced from the #32 issue comments and are not committed.

## Concept: the Switchboard

Routing is shown as a live switchboard. A modern look is allowed; the telephone-exchange / rail-yard imagery is inspiration, not a requirement.
- **Left rail – calls**: each user message enters as a "call" with its timestamp, the suggested role (shape + name + confidence) and its first words.
- **Middle – the patch bay**: Jev's suggestion is a dashed *ghost wire* to a role jack (orchestrator, oracle, fixer, explorer, designer). A separate hollow `ctx` ring beside each jack marks the **recorded context agent**. Agreement = the suggestion jack and the ctx ring are the same role. Disagreement is stated in text (`differs`) and drawn as a dotted bracket.
- **Right rail – aggregate**: one entry per provider/model/variant from the stats file, sized by steps, explicitly **not linked to calls**.
- **Bottom – the ticker tape**: dense, monospaced event log, filterable, clickable to drill down.
- Drawers (nav row, keys 1–8): Agreement, Usage, Errors, History, Alerts, Quota, Presets, Export. Approved in #41: a ninth, Sessions (key 9).
- Not drawn in v1 (evidence limits, see "Evidence-driven deviations"): per-call agent→model cables and fallback sparks.

## Typography (Lane Bay)

Fonts stay the existing local files (`web/assets/fonts.css`): **Instrument Sans** (labels, prompts, notes) and **IBM Plex Mono** (data, tabular numerals everywhere). No new fonts, files or dependencies.

| Step | Size | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xs | **11 px** (floor, nothing smaller) | caps labels, notes, ticker cells, meta lines, jack counts |
| sm | 12 / 12.5 px | views nav; rail prompts at ≤1280 px |
| md | 13 px | body, rail prompts at ≥1440 px, focus prompt |
| lg | 15 px bold | wordmark, readout values |

- Wordmark: sentence case, ink, 15 px bold (was amber caps 13 px). Readout values 15 px (was 20 px). All six readouts stay, each with its note.
- Caps labels are 11 px bold with letter spacing. No giant hero text.

## Color system (Lane Bay: graphite, flat)

| Token | Hex | Role | Replaces | Contrast on bg / panel / panel2 *(computed)* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--bg` | `#0B0D10` | app background | `#0E0F0C` | n/a |
| `--panel` | `#10131A` | header, rails | `#171914` | n/a |
| `--panel2` | `#171B24` | selected row, raised card (new) | selection used `--panel` | n/a |
| `--line` | `#232831` | hairlines | `#2A2D25` | 1.3:1, decorative separators only |
| `--ink` | `#E7EAEF` | primary text | `#E8E4D8` | 16.1 / 15.4 / 14.3 |
| `--dim` | `#8590A0` | secondary text | `#8C8A80` | 6.0 / 5.7 / 5.3 |
| `--dim2` | `#5B6473` | **non-text only**: idle rings, dashed frame (new) | n/a | 3.3 / 3.1 / **2.9**; never text, never on `--panel2` |
| `--sel` | `#C8F169` | selection bar, focus ring, selected wire origin (new) | `--amber` for selection/focus | 15.0 / 14.4 / 13.3 |
| `--warn` | `#F2B548` | warning, stale, connecting, **DEMO band fill**, `NOT LINKED TO CALLS` label | `#FFB000` | 10.6 / 10.2 / 9.4 |
| `--ok` | `#5FD9A0` | live, ok | `#7BD88F` | 11.0 / 10.5 / 9.8 |
| `--err` | `#FF6B5B` | error, link down | `#FF5A3C` | 7.0 / 6.6 / 6.2 |
| `--ghost` | ink at **45%** (`#6E7074` on bg) | dashed Jev suggestion wire | ink at 35% | 3.9 on bg (35% was 2.8) |

- **Role hues:** orchestrator `#E8C26A` (moved off amber so it no longer shares a hue with warning/DEMO; 11.4 / 10.9 / 10.1). The other four keep their previous hues: oracle `#C792EA` (used sparingly, 8.1 / 7.7 / 7.2), fixer `#3CC8B4` (9.4 / 8.9 / 8.3), explorer `#82AAFF` (8.5 / 8.1 / 7.5), designer `#F78C6C` (8.3 / 7.9 / 7.3).
- **Role shapes** identify roles without hue: orchestrator diamond, oracle hexagon, fixer circle, explorer square, designer pentagon. They appear in jacks, rail rows and ticker cells.
- **Recorded context** is a hollow ring in ink (lit 2 px with a centre dot when it matches the selected call). There is no accent colour for it, because a cyan ring collided with the fixer teal.
- `--amber` is retired as a general token (split into `--sel` and `--warn`). `--teal` is unused: no real path is drawn in v1.
- **DEMO band:** solid, full width, `--warn` fill, dark text (10.6:1), 18 px. Prominence is deliberate.
- Flat colors and 1 px hairlines only. No purple/blue gradients, no glassmorphism, no glow, no shadows, no grain, no neon-on-everything.

### States use icon shape + word, colour only reinforces

| State | Icon | Word | Colour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| live / ok | filled disc | `live`, `ok` | `--ok` |
| connecting | dashed ring | `connecting` | `--warn` |
| stale | half-filled disc | `stale` | `--warn` |
| missing / not confirmed | hollow ring | `missing`, `last known live` | `--dim` or `--warn` |
| link down | ring with ✕ | `link down` | `--err` |
| error | triangle with `!` | error name, e.g. `TimeoutError` | `--err` |

## Layout, density and responsive hierarchy

Top to bottom: **DEMO band → header readouts → source bar → views nav → scope strip → stage (calls | patch bay | aggregate) → ticker.**

| Element | 1440×900 | 1024×768 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DEMO band | 18 px | same |
| Header (wordmark + six readouts + link) | 56 px | same |
| Source bar / views nav / scope strip | 34 / 28 / 26 px | same |
| Chrome above the stage | 162 px | 162 px |
| Stage columns (calls / bay / aggregate) | 300 / 840 / 300 | 256 / 536 / 232 |
| Call rail rows | 40 px | **36 px** |
| Ticker: title 24 + filters 26 + header 22 + rows 22 each | 248 px for 8 rows | 208 px for 5 rows, with two filter rows |
| Stage height | 490 px | 398 px |
| Active alert row | +22 px | +22 px |

- **22 px ticker rows hold.** Panel titles 24 px, filter rows 26 px. Gap/padding base is 4 px; inherited component heights (22/24/26) are kept.
- The ticker height is sized so no half row shows at the two target viewports. With an active alert it grows to 270 / 230 px and the stage shrinks to 468 / 376 px, retaining 8 / 5 full data rows. Without an exchange source bar, chrome is 34 px shorter and that space belongs to the stage. Aggregate column measurements are grid tracks; the dashed panel has a 4 px inset on each side.
- **Measured #33 containment adaptations:** the bay body scrolls internally when all roles and the sparse tally cannot fit alongside replay, focus and legend; those controls and notes do not shrink. All five roles/tally rows remain reachable without dropping calls. Long compact focus lines scroll horizontally. The 24 px ticker title also scrolls horizontally with keyboard focus and arrow keys when full counts/intake/hints exceed the viewport; no disclosure is removed. Only prompt cells use ellipsis.
- **Readouts:** prompts/min, context agreement, fallback (`n/d`), error rate, p50 latency, tokens today, each with its note (`last 60 s`, `6 of 8 compared`, `not detectable`, `retained window`, `stats range ≠ today`). No metric is added or dropped. Optional note on p50: `classifier · retained window` (the value is the classifier latency from observe/route records).
- **Clipping fixes (required by this contract):**
  - Patch-bay title is short (`PATCH BAY · suggestion vs recorded context`); the legend lives in the bay foot as two lines that may wrap.
   - The source-health row is split into single-line concerns: views nav row; scope strip with file lamps; intake text in the ticker title. At ≥1440 the intake line keeps the existing full text; at ≤1280 it becomes `intake: malformed N · rejected N`. **The detailed `rejected payloads` count lives in the Errors drawer**, per the [#33 scope approval](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/33#issuecomment-6715778224); reuse the existing counter without adding a metric or changing ingestion.
  - Row counter (`N of M sent`) sits in a fixed, never-truncated right slot. Filters keep every existing control and wrap to two rows at ≤1280; if anything truncates it is the scope label.
  - **Call in focus is never hidden.** At ≥1440 it stays in the bay as today. At ≤1280 a **compact two-line call in focus** sits in the bay foot (suggestion + conf, ctx agent and `same role`/`differs`, decision, classifier latency, exec agent/model `—`, fallback `not detectable`). The full record stays in the detail drawer (`Enter`). This replaces hiding the panel at ≤1280.
  - Latency and prompt stay visible at ≤1280; reason, oracle, classifier, fallback and session are what moves to detail there.

## Navigation and terminology

- **Source bar:** keeps its radiogroup behaviour (combined + per-source, arrow keys). Only the look changes: pill radios with state icon + word; `last seen` is shown at ≥1440 and kept in the tooltip at ≤1280.
- **Views nav:** its own text-tab row with the existing digits 1–8, never wrapping. Alerts shows ▲ plus the count when active. No new views, no sidebar, no Settings, no theme selector. **Exception approved in #41:** one added view, Sessions (ninth tab, key `9`); see "Sessions inspector". Nothing else in this sentence changes.
- **Scope strip:** one line that states the viewed source, its state, last event time and the retained count, e.g. `viewing pc · live · last event 02:03:35 UTC · 8 calls retained`, plus file lamps (`observe ok · route ok · permissions ok · stats ok`; `stats missing`; `no files read yet`; `last known:` under link down). Counts must reuse the existing sent/retained values; this adds no metric and no connection-state machine (transport state belongs to #24).

| Term | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `link live` / `link down` | unchanged (transport) |
| `ctx agent` | unchanged; legend: "recorded context agent, not proof of delegation" |
| `exec agent/model` | one column reading `—` (was two columns that always read `—`) |
| `differs` | text label on the dotted bracket between the suggestion jack and the ctx ring; replaces the plain kink |
| aggregate rail | panel `AGGREGATE · stats only`, label `NOT LINKED TO CALLS` in `--warn` caps |

## Selected-call detail

Fields, in order: suggestion + conf; needs oracle; decision + reason; ctx agent; ctx vs suggestion (`same role` / `differs`); classifier + latency; exec agent/model `—`; fallback `not detectable`; tokens/cost `—`. Error rows show `suggestion — classifier failed`, `failure <name>`, `latency <n> ms` with the error icon. The selected call is a 2 px `--sel` bar with a `--panel2` fill in the rail and the ticker. Selected is not the same as focused (see Keyboard).

## Sessions inspector (approved in #41)

Status: **approved contract (maintainer decisions of 2026-11-08 in #41), implemented in #43 and measured in isolated Linux Chromium against anonymized DEMO inputs (captures `docs/screenshots/m43-*`; see "Implementation notes").** It is the only addition to the view list, and it revises the "no new views" line (see Contract status). Everything below reuses Lane Bay tokens, type steps, 22 px rows and the 2 px `--sel` focus ring; it adds no colour, font, motion or dependency.

**Purpose.** A read-only place to read what the retained sample holds for one session of one source, in order, with each field's evidence state. It is a reading aid, not a task monitor: it does not say what ran, whether it worked, or that the session is complete.

### Entry points

1. **From a selected event:** a `session` action in the event detail drawer (and key `s` while an event is selected) opens the inspector on that event's session, with the same event highlighted.
2. **From the Sessions tab (key `9`):** opens the session list for the viewed source.
3. Both are shown only for the viewed source. In the combined view the list is shown without first choosing a source, and each session row carries its source id (maintainer decision: friendlier than forcing a source choice); sessions of different sources are never merged or joined, even if the raw session strings match (the federated id is `JSON.stringify([sourceId, session])`).

### Structure

- **List** (one row per session present in the sent events): source, session, first–last event time, sent count, error mark (triangle `!` + word), permission count. Sorted newest last event first. 22 px rows. Names are the session strings as recorded; no titles, no task names, no inferred outcome.
- **Detail**: scope header, then the ordered session timeline (reuses the existing `session timeline` rows and `sessionTimeline()` order), then the selected row's fields, then permission verdicts, then the "not execution" block.
- **Replay:** reuses the existing replay cursor (play/pause/speed, `p , . [ ]`, one cursor shared with the timeline, selection and Call in focus). The inspector adds no second cursor and no new transport. Replay stays a client cursor over the retained sample, not durable history.
- **Read-only:** no execute, retry, approve, deny, rerun, edit or delete control; no success/“completed” indicator; no row, session or header colour implies pass/fail. Error rows keep the existing error triangle and error name, as elsewhere.

### Layout (proposed values; browser-measured in #43, see "Implementation notes" for the values that changed)

| Element | 1440×900 | 1024×768 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Placement | a panel laid over the stage only (below the chrome, above the ticker); same open/close, `Esc`, focus return | same, full stage width |
| Panes | two: list ~280 px proposed (**440 px implemented**), detail the rest | one at a time: list, then detail with a `← sessions` back control; `Esc` goes detail → list → close |
| Chrome kept | DEMO band, header, source bar, views nav, scope strip and ticker stay visible and unchanged | same |
| Scope header | 2 lines max, 11 px caps labels + 13 px values | 3 lines max; wraps, never truncates counts |
| Row height | 22 px (timeline and list) | 22 px |
| Overflow | list and detail scroll inside the panel; long session strings scroll horizontally, not ellipsis | same |

The 640–720 px drawer width recorded in the M4 review does not fit two panes, so the inspector is not a drawer: it takes the full stage width (measured, see below). If it does not fit at 1024×768 without clipping a count, the single-pane rule above is the fallback, not a smaller font (floor stays 11 px).

### Navigation decision (calculated from fonts and CSS; browser-measured in #43, see below)

Question: can the views row take a ninth tab without wrapping or clipping at 1024 px, given `.views-nav` is `display:flex; flex-wrap:nowrap; overflow:hidden; gap:2px; padding:0 12px` and each tab is `padding:0 10px`, label 12.5 px Instrument Sans, digit 11 px IBM Plex Mono with 4 px margin?

Method: advance widths summed from the repository's own `InstrumentSans-Regular/Bold.ttf` and `IBMPlexMono-Regular.ttf` (`hmtx`/`cmap` tables, read with a throwaway Python script outside the repo; nothing installed). For each tab the wider of regular and bold was used (the active tab is bold). Kerning, hinting, subpixel rounding and the Alerts badge are **not** modelled.

| | Sum of tabs + gaps + 24 px padding | Share of 1024 px |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eight tabs (today) | ≈ 629 px | ≈ 61 % |
| Nine tabs (+ Sessions, ≈ 83.5 px) | ≈ 714 px | ≈ 70 % |
| Nine tabs + active Alerts badge (≈ 30 px estimated: 6 margin + 8 padding + 2 border + digits) | ≈ 745 px | ≈ 73 % |

Result: the model leaves about 280 px of slack at 1024 px, so a ninth tab is expected to fit without wrapping. **Decision: ninth tab `Sessions`, key `9`** (the key handler already accepts `1`…`DRAWERS.length`), **approved by the maintainer, subject to a browser measurement in #43 confirming no clipping at 1024×768 with the Alerts badge active. That measurement passed (see "Implementation notes"); the fallback is not needed.** Maintainer-approved fallback if that measurement fails: no tab; entry only from the event detail `session` action and key `s`, with the list as the first state of the inspector. This is a calculation from font files, not a rendered measurement; the 1280 px tier was not computed (larger than 1024, so it is not the binding case).

### Three field states (shape and word, never colour alone)

Every field in the inspector carries exactly one of these, as a chip of the word plus a glyph; the chip border pattern also differs.

| State | Glyph + word | Border | Meaning | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recorded | `▮ recorded` | solid 1 px | the value is in a retained source record (observe, route, permissions) | shows the record kind in the row: `observe`, `route`, `permissions` |
| Explicitly enriched | `＋ enriched · validated` | solid 1 px + `via <field>` text | value came from an optional enrichment field that passed validation **and** is attributable to this session/message | shown only where both hold. Otherwise the field is not available. Never inferred, never from aggregate stats, never from the current preset |
| Not available | `— not available` | dashed 1 px | the sources do not establish it | always with a reason, e.g. `not in Jev logs`, `no validated enrichment` |

Colours only reinforce: recorded `--ink`, enriched `--ink`, not available `--dim` (never `--dim2` for text). Source-reviewed fact for #41: in `FlowEvent` the execution agent/model/provider/variant fields are typed `null` (`src/core/aggregate.ts`), and enrichment is consumed by analytics, not attached to events. So at first implementation **every execution field is `— not available`**, and the enriched state is defined here but may be unused until an enriched, attributable value is wired in under its own approval.

### Scope header

One header above the timeline, always visible, never collapsed:

`source <id> · session <string> · sent <n> · retained <n> (source window) · omitted <n> · evicted <n> · sample, not a complete archive`

- **sent** is the count of this session's events the client holds (from the sent events; the same value as `replayCoverage().inSession`).
- **retained, omitted, evicted** reuse the existing `window` counters of the viewed source (`window.events` retained/omitted, `window.evicted.observe + route`). They are source-window figures, labelled so; a per-session retained count is not claimed, because omitted rows cannot be attributed to a session.
- When `omitted > 0` or `evicted > 0` the header adds `older events of this session may be missing` (the existing `mayBeIncomplete` rule). When both are 0 it still says `sample`, because rotation, restart and the retention cap are outside the counters.
- Under link down or stale: the existing `last known` wording; the inspector never shows a fresher claim than the scope strip.

### Permission verdicts

A section `permission gate · this session` lists the retained permission records whose (federated) session equals the inspected one. Same data and handling as the Errors drawer: same fields (ts, verdict, commands, reversible, routine, latency), same ● allow / ◆ other glyph-plus-word rule, `—` for absent `scores`, commands shown as recorded, same `newest k of n retained verdicts listed` note taken from `window.permissions`, and the empty text `no permission verdicts in the retained window`. Verdicts are the gate's recorded output, not an approval event: no approve/deny control, and no sentence such as “approved by user”.

### Not execution

A fixed block, `ROUTER · recommendation, not execution`, groups the Jev suggestion, confidence, needs-oracle, route decision and reason, ctx agent, and `classifier model` (the observe `model` is the classifier, not the execution model). Labels follow the existing terms (`ctx agent` = “recorded context agent, not proof of delegation”; `injected` = recommendation injected, not proof that the suggested agent ran). Below it: `exec agent/model — not available`, `fallback not detectable`, `tokens/cost — not available`, `linked stats none (aggregate stats are not attributable to a session)`. No success, finished, passed or duration-of-task wording anywhere; the span between first and last event is labelled `observed event span`, never run time.

This is a drawing in text, not a capture. Labelled DEMO mockups or screenshots required by #41 were **not produced** (no browser or dependencies were available in this docs-only lane and none were installed); they remain open for #43.

### Implementation notes (#43, measured in isolated Linux Chromium; DEMO data, not an accessibility audit)

Measured with Playwright 1.64.1 driving `/usr/bin/chromium` 155 against `scripts/demo-exchange.ts` (anonymized fixtures, three sources, Alerts badge active as `▲4`) at 1440×900 and 1024×768, reduced motion on. Captures: `docs/screenshots/m43-{nav-alerts,sessions-list,sessions-detail,sessions-detail-lower,sessions-entry-s}-{1440x900,1024x768}.png`, reviewed against this file.

- **Nav fit (the condition of the ninth-tab decision):** nine tabs sit on one row (no wrapping), the row's `scrollWidth` equals its `clientWidth` (1440 and 1024), the last tab's right edge is at **714 px** with the Alerts badge active, and the row stays 28 px. This is below the ≈ 745 px estimate, so the font arithmetic was conservative. The no-tab fallback is not needed.
- **Placement (revised after review):** the inspector is **not** a drawer. It is a panel laid over the stage only (`position: absolute; inset: 0` inside `main.stage`), so the DEMO band, header, source bar, views nav, scope strip and the whole ticker stay visible and clickable, as the "Chrome kept" row requires. Measured: panel 1440×468 at y 162 and 1024×376 at y 162 (the stage heights with an active alert; 490 / 398 without); ticker unchanged at 270 / 230 px with the alert row. `elementFromPoint` on the header, all nine nav tabs, the scope strip and the ticker title returns those elements, not the panel. The ticker stays interactive: selecting a ticker row opens the event detail and closes the inspector, like any other overlay.
- **Call in focus:** the stage that normally shows it is covered, so the existing compact two-line readout (`CompactFocus`, same fields and text) is pinned at the top of the panel, on the replay cursor's event (or the selected / newest ticker call when nothing is replayed). It is never hidden, at both sizes (39 px).
- **Panes:** at 1440 two panes, list **440 px** (not ~280: a 22 px row must hold source, session, first–last time, sent, error mark and permission count in words, and 280 px clipped them), detail the rest. One pane at a time with the `← sessions` back control at **1100 px and below** (contract: 1024; the in-between widths have room for two panes, so the cut sits just above 1024 and not at the 1280 tier).
- **Rows and header:** list and timeline rows measured 22 px; no clipped list row content; no horizontal overflow in the detail pane or the timeline. The scope header wraps and never truncates counts. Long session strings scroll horizontally inside the list cell and wrap in the scope header. Lists and detail scroll inside the panel, so no half row can appear in the ticker or the nav.
- **Drawers unchanged:** the other eight drawers keep their 720 / 700 px width and tab strip (eight tabs fit: strip 596 / 576 px, `scrollWidth` = `clientWidth`). Sessions has no entry in the drawer tabs, so from inside another drawer it is reached with key `9` or, while the nav is visible, its nav tab. An earlier iteration made Sessions a ninth drawer tab and widened every drawer to 810 / 780 px; that is reverted.
- **Keyboard:** `Esc` goes detail → list → close with focus returning (row in the list, then the opener). Inside the detail, `↑ ↓`, `j k` and `, .` move the selected row and the shared replay cursor (and pause it); `p` and `[ ]` act on the same cursor; `r` is unchanged. In the list, `↑ ↓` move between rows. Key `s` works from the ticker or the event detail only, not while another drawer is open. The nav (including the Alerts badge) stays clickable while the inspector is open: another view's tab switches to that drawer, the Sessions tab toggles the inspector.
- **Refinements to the text of this contract:** the empty permission text reads `no permission verdicts in the retained window for this session`; the enriched chip shows `＋ enriched · validated` without `via <field>` because the #42 model carries no source field for it (and nothing produces enriched yet); the `session` action in the event detail reads `session → inspect (s)`.

### Not in the inspector

Task identity or graph, parent/child edges, task outcome, external evidence (#5), allocation of aggregate stats to a session, USD or quota attribution, fallback attempts, exports from this view, any write or control action, and native-app migration.

## Ticker tape

- Title `TICKER TAPE · newest k of n retained`, intake text, and the existing key hints. Active alerts are one 22 px row above the filters.
- **Columns by tier:**
  - Always: ts, src, suggest (shape + role), conf, decision, ctx agent (ring + role), exec agent/model `—`, latency, error, prompt.
  - ≥1440 only: session, oracle, reason, classifier, fallback.
  - **Detail drawer only: message, tokens, cost.** They always read `—` in v1, so removing the columns hides no data.
- Ellipsis is allowed on prompt cells only; the full text stays in the detail drawer.
- Rows are 22 px. The ticker renders at most the newest 300 transmitted rows and says so (unchanged from M4a).

## Aggregate stats are separate

The aggregate rail has a dashed `--dim2` frame, the `NOT LINKED TO CALLS` label, its own `stats range … to …` and `source …`, then one entry per model (name, variant chip, a bar sized by steps, `N steps · $cost`) and totals. Missing or pending stats read `stats not received · nothing estimated` / `stats pending`, with models, steps and cost `—`. It never feeds per-call metrics, and `tokens today` stays `—` when the stats range is not today.

## Motion rules

- New call: token travels the wire in 400–600 ms (ease-out), jack pulses once. Fallback: 120 ms spark (only if a fallback is ever observable).
- Motion encodes data only (arrival, routing, failure); nothing loops idly. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (switch to instant + highlight, with `--sel` as the highlight; the token is static).
- Max 60 fps, animate transform/opacity only; batch bursts (> 10 events/s collapse into a counter).
- The new identity adds no motion. Any added motion needs measured evidence before it is specified.

## Keyboard and focus (intent, not runtime-verified)

- Existing keys unchanged: `/` search, `f` filters, `j/k` rows, `enter` drill-down, `1`–`8` views, `esc`.
- **Focus ring:** 2 px `--sel`, 1 px offset, on every control and on the active ticker row while the event-row scroll region holds focus. That container keeps no outline of its own, so the row indicator must be explicit. `#ticker` names this inner region after the filters, not the outer layout section.
- Source radios: arrow keys move the choice, as today. Escape behaviour (search blur, drawer close) is unchanged.
- Tab order: source bar → views nav → existing bay/replay controls → scrollable ticker title → ticker filters → event rows. The extra title stop preserves keyboard access to long disclosures; the row stop follows the filters. No focus trap or roving views navigation is introduced.

## Density guidelines

- Every event exposes: ts (local, ms), session, message, Jev role + confidence + needs_oracle, route decision + reason, agent, model/provider/variant, fallback (yes/no/unknown), latency, tokens in/out/reasoning/cost, errors. Fields that do not fit a column are in the detail drawer, which holds the full raw record.
- Header readouts: the six above. Ticker rows 22 px.
- Filters: time range, source, session, role, ctx agent, classifier, decision, errors only; keyboard shortcuts as above.
- Drill-down panel: full event JSON, timeline of the session, linked stats.
- Empty/missing-file states are designed (a "silent exchange" with the expected path), not blank.

## Anti-slop rules (hard)
- No default shadcn card grids, no rounded-2xl card wall, no purple gradients, no emoji headers, no "✨ Insights" copy.
- No stock dashboard layout (KPI cards row + two charts). The switchboard is the primary view.
- No placeholder lorem or fake data in the live UI; fixtures only in tests/demo mode labeled "DEMO".
- Charts are custom SVG (or a tiny lib) styled to the system; no default chart-lib theme.
- Copy is terse and technical.

## Verification
Each UI milestone ends with screenshots (Playwright, 1440×900 and 1024×768, live with fixtures replayed) saved to
`docs/screenshots/` and reviewed against this file; list every deviation.
- Cover populated, empty, partial and error/disconnected states at both sizes, with DEMO visible. Link-down must come from a real disconnect, not only a drawn state (see #24).
- Layout values above must stay backed by browser measurements. The token assertion in `test/ui-shell.test.tsx` ("stylesheet follows DESIGN tokens") is updated explicitly with the accepted identity in #33; do not weaken or skip it. The font-size ceiling check (≤ 20 px) still holds.
- A new-user comprehension exercise (protocol drafted for #32) has not been run. Comprehension is unknown until it is.

## Evidence-driven deviations (v1)

SPEC's documented evidence limits take precedence over the conceptual execution wiring:
- Draw dashed Jev suggestion wires only. A separate hollow `ctx` jack denotes the recorded context agent; matching jacks indicate **context agreement**, not proven delegation.
- Do not draw solid per-call agent-to-model execution cables. The right rail is explicitly **aggregate stats, unlinked to calls**, sized by steps. No fallback spark is drawn without an observable fallback.
- Fallback reads `not detectable`, with no invented percentage. Execution agent/model/provider/variant, per-message tokens and cost read `—`; classifier model remains a separately labeled field.
- At narrower widths, lower-priority ticker fields may move into the event detail drawer rather than becoming unreadably compressed. Complete raw records remain inspectable there.
- Fixture replay is explicitly labeled `DEMO`; live mode never fills missing sources with fixtures.
- Detail lists show `newest k of n retained` and omitted/evicted counts when bounded. Aggregate readouts describe the retained window, not just visible or transmitted rows. Malformed counters are labeled process-lifetime; stats tool failures display their own stats range.

These are semantic corrections, not permission to relax the palette, typography, density, motion or anti-slop rules.

## Deferred / out of contract

Not part of this contract; each needs its own approval.
- **Curved (bezier) wires.** Orthogonal wires stay (M4a); no evidence yet that curves help. Separate approval.
- **Persistent right-hand inspector** merging call in focus and aggregate stats. Structural panel relocation. Separate approval.
- **Light theme / theme selector.** Not in this contract; a separate decision (visual preferences are coordinated in #31).
- **Crosspoint matrix** (exploration B). Separate approval; may suit the Agreement drawer, not the main screen.
- **B ideas** (`HOW TO READ` block, source list with a status word, hatched aggregate label, sidebar navigation): routed to [#25](https://github.com/crisesarmiento/opencode-routing-dashboard/issues/25) for consideration with guided reading. None is part of this contract.
- **Rejected:** a cyan context ring (hue collides with fixer teal); the full softened role-hue set (only orchestrator moves).
- **Out of scope here:** connection-state behaviour (#24), guided-reading content (#25), desktop packaging (#27), new metrics, execution cables, new fonts or dependencies.

## Previous identity (shipped until #33 lands)

These values describe the UI as shipped today. `web/styles.css` and `test/ui-shell.test.tsx` still use them.

### Typography
- Data/mono: **JetBrains Mono** or **IBM Plex Mono** (tabular numerals everywhere).
- Labels/display: **Space Grotesk** or **Instrument Sans**; condensed caps for jack labels.
- Sizes: 11/12 px for table cells, 13 px body, 20 px numbers in the header readouts. No giant hero text.

### Color system (dark "exchange room", amber phosphor)
- Background `#0E0F0C` (warm near-black), panels `#171914`, hairlines `#2A2D25`.
- Ink `#E8E4D8`, dim ink `#8C8A80`.
- Signal: amber `#FFB000` (live/active), cable teal `#3CC8B4` (real path), ghost `#E8E4D8` at 35% dashed (Jev suggestion).
- States: ok `#7BD88F`, warn `#FFB000`, error `#FF5A3C` (also shown by shape/icon, not color alone).
- Roles get fixed hues: orchestrator amber, oracle `#C792EA` used sparingly only for oracle jacks, fixer teal, explorer `#82AAFF`, designer `#F78C6C`.
- No purple/blue gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon-on-everything. Flat colors, 1 px hairlines, subtle scanline/grain texture at most 3% opacity.

## Historical reviews (previous amber identity)

The M4a, M4, M9 and M11 reviews below describe the previous amber-phosphor identity. That identity remains what the shipped UI shows until #33 lands. They are kept as the historical record; where they conflict with the Lane Bay contract above, the contract governs UI work done under #33.

## M4a review

Reviewed live, empty, event-detail and arrival captures under `docs/screenshots/m4a-*`.
The following layout choices are accepted: an optional call-in-focus readout above
1280 px; drawer navigation in the source-health row; lowercase ticker labels;
orthogonal suggestion wires with a 500 ms arrival token on their final segment;
flat background without optional grain. The ticker renders at most the newest
300 transmitted rows and states the limit. Full transmitted raw records remain
available through event detail. These choices preserve the exchange-room
palette, compact typography, 22 px rows and no-idle-animation constraint.

M4a intentionally leaves view drawers and search/filter shortcuts for M4; they
are disabled and labeled, not presented as working functionality.

## M4 review

Flow, Agreement, Usage, Errors and empty History were reviewed at both target
viewports (`docs/screenshots/m4-*`). M4 replaces the disabled M4a navigation
with working drawers, filters and keyboard controls. Accepted adaptations:
right-side overlays are 640–720 px wide with internal view tabs and close;
filters stay visible in the ticker, whose height becomes 244 px / 192 px;
Escape from search blurs and allows the browser's native query-clear behavior;
the narrow filter-scope label may truncate, while the ticker retains the full
scope label. These choices preserve visible DEMO labeling, 22 px data rows,
local fonts and the switchboard as the primary view.

## M9 review

Reviewed source-backed fixture captures `m9-real-*` (PC agent, Orca agent and
local collector) plus deterministic edge-state `m9-*` harness captures at
1440×900 and 1024×768. “real” names the real transport in this demo, not real
user data. Combined, configured Orca provenance, replay, quota/presets and sparse
bay captures preserve the phosphor palette, local typography, 22 px rows,
hairlines, ghost-only routing and the exchange as the primary view.

Accepted adaptations:
- Source lamps occupy a separate compact row, with glyphs and text for live,
  stale, connecting and error. Source-wide client labels remain configured.
- Alerts, quota, presets and export use the existing drawers and keys 5–8.
  Quota bars are small SVGs; unknown/partial evidence is textual, not a
  fabricated zero or execution cable. Combined model totals stay unavailable.
- Sparse bays compress real call spacing and add role counts, never dummy calls.
  Replay places a compact transport at the bay's lower edge and uses one cursor
  for the wire, selection, timeline and Call in focus; its retained sample and
  non-durable nature are visible. Narrow layouts retain details in the drawer.
- Orphaned filter values remain visibly selectable; eviction restores focus to
  the ticker; rejected payload count lives in the source-health strip. These are
  behavioral corrections, not visual departures from the switchboard system.
- Preset columns label Jev latency/context agreement and recorded/estimated
  attribution. File samples cannot prove runtime selection. Report controls
  share the period picker and use same-origin GET downloads only.

No new palette, card grid, glass effect, idle animation or UI dependency was added.

## M11 acceptance review

Opened/reviewed `m11-alert-ticker-{1440x900,1024x768}.png`, captured with the
source-backed DEMO agents. The active-alert strip uses the existing 22 px row,
hairlines, amber glyph/source labels and precise classifier/execution text.
It belongs to the ticker, opens the existing alert drawer, follows source
selection and disappears without active evidence. No idle motion or new visual
system is introduced; the one-row increase in ticker controls is accepted.
